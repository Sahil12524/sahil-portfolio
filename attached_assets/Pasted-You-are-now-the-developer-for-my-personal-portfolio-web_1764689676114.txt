You are now the developer for my personal portfolio website. 
Create a fully polished, modern, responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Follow these exact requirements:

1. OVERALL DESIGN
- Clean, modern, tech-looking UI (like Vercel, GitHub, Tailwind-style aesthetics).
- Full-width hero section — must look like a proper website, NOT like a Word document.
- Centered, balanced spacing, good padding/margins, not cramped.
- Light/Dark mode toggle if easy.
- Typography: clean, readable, evenly spaced.
- Proper section separation using spacing, dividers, or background contrasts.

2. SECTIONS TO INCLUDE (in this order):
- HERO:
  * My name: "Sahil Bhandari"
  * Title: "Systems & Assembly Developer"
  * Short tagline: “Low-level programming • OS internals • Performance-focused”

- SKILLS:
  Separate categories clearly (NOT all in one line):
    * C Programming
    * C++ Programming
    * x86-64 Assembly (NASM)
    * Low-Level Systems
    * Reverse Engineering (beginner)
    * Performance Optimization

- REPOSITORIES:
  Make separate blocks/cards for:
    * C
    * C++
    * Assembly
  Each card must have:
    - Title
    - Short description
    - GitHub link placeholder

- PROJECTS:
  Add 3 placeholder projects with screenshots (use placeholder images), description, and demo links.

- CONTACT:
  Provide nice looking social buttons for:
    GitHub, LinkedIn, Email

3. LAYOUT STYLE:
- Use a wide layout (max-width: 1400px).
- Spacing similar to modern developer landing pages.
- Cards with shadow, hover effects.
- Smooth fade animations.
- Use CSS only (no Tailwind unless I ask).
- DO NOT make it look like a document.

4. FILE STRUCTURE:
Provide:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

5. REQUIREMENTS FOR CODE:
- Clean, minimal, readable code.
- Responsive for mobile and large screens.
- Should run instantly on Replit without dependencies.
- Use neutral color palette (blues/greys or dark black theme).
- Avoid too much text — clean sections.

6. FINAL OUTPUT:
- Provide ALL three files completely.
- Then provide a preview screenshot (if possible).
- Make sure the website looks extremely polished and professional.

Make sure the website looks like something a serious low-level developer would show for job applications.
